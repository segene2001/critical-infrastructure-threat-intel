# Financial Services Sector Guide

## Overview

This guide provides specific information for using the Critical Infrastructure Threat Intelligence Framework in financial services environments, including credit unions, community banks, and Farm Credit System institutions.

## Regulatory Compliance

### FFIEC Cybersecurity Assessment Tool (CAT)

The framework supports FFIEC CAT compliance by:

- **Threat Intelligence & Vulnerability Management**: Automated threat collection and analysis
- **Cyber Incident Management**: Threat-based incident detection and response
- **External Dependency Management**: Third-party threat monitoring

### Farm Credit Administration (FCA) Requirements

For Farm Credit System institutions:

- Cybersecurity program requirements (12 CFR Part 618)
- Vendor management and third-party risk
- Incident reporting obligations

### GLBA Safeguards Rule

Supports GLBA compliance through:

- Risk assessment based on current threats
- Access controls informed by threat intelligence
- Monitoring and testing using threat data

## Institution Types

### Credit Unions

**Typical Assets Protected:**
- Core banking systems
- Online/mobile banking
- ATM networks
- Member data

**Common Threats:**
- Ransomware
- Wire fraud
- Credential theft
- DDoS attacks

**Configuration Example:**

```python
from src.sector_analyzers import FinancialServicesAnalyzer

analyzer = FinancialServicesAnalyzer()
threats = analyzer.analyze_threats(
    threat_data=collected_threats,
    institution_type='credit_union',
    compliance_frameworks=['FFIEC', 'NCUA']
)
```

### Farm Credit Institutions

**Typical Assets Protected:**
- Loan origination systems
- Agricultural customer data
- Wire transfer systems
- Customer portals

**Common Threats:**
- Business email compromise
- Ransomware
- Supply chain attacks
- Agricultural data theft

**Configuration Example:**

```python
threats = analyzer.analyze_threats(
    threat_data=collected_threats,
    institution_type='farm_credit',
    compliance_frameworks=['FFIEC', 'FCA']
)
```

### Community Banks

**Typical Assets Protected:**
- Core banking
- Commercial lending
- Treasury management
- Customer data

**Common Threats:**
- Ransomware
- DDoS
- Insider threats
- Third-party compromises

## Use Cases

### 1. Daily Threat Monitoring

```python
from src.threat_collector import ThreatCollector
from src.threat_analyzer import ThreatAnalyzer

# Collect latest threats
collector = ThreatCollector()
threats = collector.collect_all()

# Analyze for financial services
analyzer = ThreatAnalyzer()
fs_threats = analyzer.analyze(threats, sector='financial_services')

# Get critical threats
critical = [t for t in fs_threats if t['analysis']['priority'] == 'critical']

# Alert security team
for threat in critical:
    print(f"CRITICAL: {threat['name']}")
    print(f"Actions: {threat['analysis']['recommendations']}")
```

### 2. Compliance Reporting

```python
from src.sector_analyzers import FinancialServicesAnalyzer

analyzer = FinancialServicesAnalyzer()
fs_threats = analyzer.analyze_threats(
    threats,
    institution_type='credit_union',
    compliance_frameworks=['FFIEC', 'FCA', 'GLBA']
)

# Generate compliance report
report = analyzer.generate_compliance_report(fs_threats)

print(f"FFIEC Affected Threats: {report['compliance_summary']['FFIEC']['affected_threats']}")
print(f"Requires Action: {report['compliance_summary']['FFIEC']['requires_action']}")
```

### 3. Incident Response

```python
# Filter threats by severity
critical_threats = analyzer.get_threats_by_priority('critical')

for threat in critical_threats:
    # Get incident response recommendations
    recommendations = threat['analysis']['recommendations']
    
    # Check regulatory reporting requirements
    reporting = threat['financial_services_analysis']['regulatory_reporting']
    
    if reporting['required']:
        print(f"Regulatory Reporting Required:")
        print(f"  Agencies: {reporting['agencies']}")
        print(f"  Timeframe: {reporting['timeframe_hours']} hours")
```

## Integration with Financial Systems

### SIEM Integration

```python
from src.integrations import SIEMIntegration

siem = SIEMIntegration(
    platform='splunk',
    host='splunk.yourbank.com',
    api_key='your-api-key'
)

# Send financial services threats to SIEM
for threat in fs_threats:
    siem.send_alert(threat)
```

### Ticketing System Integration

```python
# Create tickets for high-priority threats
for threat in fs_threats:
    if threat['analysis']['priority'] in ['critical', 'high']:
        # Create ServiceNow ticket
        ticket = {
            'short_description': threat['name'],
            'description': threat['description'],
            'priority': threat['analysis']['priority'],
            'category': 'Security Incident'
        }
        # Send to ticketing system
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Daily Operations

- Run threat collection every hour
- Review critical threats immediately
- Update SIEM rules daily
- Brief security team on new threats

### 2. Compliance

- Map threats to FFIEC CAT domains
- Document threat-based risk assessments
- Maintain audit trail of threat responses
- Include in board reporting

### 3. Incident Response

- Use threat intelligence to prioritize incidents
- Reference IOCs in investigations
- Update playbooks based on new threats
- Share intelligence with FS-ISAC

### 4. Third-Party Risk

- Monitor threats affecting vendors
- Assess vendor security based on threat landscape
- Include threat intelligence in vendor reviews

## Regulatory Reporting

### When to Report

Report to regulators when:
- Critical threat affects your institution
- Successful attack occurs
- Customer data potentially compromised
- Operational disruption expected

### Reporting Timeframes

- **NCUA**: 72 hours for cyber incidents
- **FCA**: Immediate for material incidents
- **FinCEN**: SAR filing for fraud/suspicious activity
- **FBI IC3**: For cybercrime incidents
